# Transfer-learning-with-a-pre-trained-network
I illustrate a powerful technique called fine-tuning where we start with a large pre-trained network and then re-train only the final layers to adapt to a new task. The method is also called transfer learning and can produce excellent results on very small datasets with very little computational time.</br>
As part of this experiment I:</br>
1)Build a custom image dataset</br>
2)Fine tune the final layers of an existing deep neural network for a new classification task.</br>
3)Load images with a DataGenerator.</br>
The results of this experiment are present in the notebook fine_tune.ipynb
